Web Crawler
===========

This is a simple __Web Crawler__. It searches a given _website_ for desired _content_.  
If it manages to find the desired content, it outputs the __url__ to the _exact page_ it found it on.  

### How to use?

Just type in `java -jar crawler.jar <url> <needle>`, where `url` is the website you want to search and `needle` - the content you are looking for.
